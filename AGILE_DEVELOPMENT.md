## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: OpenAI API Rate Limiting

**Problem**:
- Frequent API calls during testing exceeded free tier limits
- Cost concerns for production deployment

**Solution**:
- Implemented request caching for similar queries
- Added rate limiting on frontend (prevent spam)
- Optimized prompts to reduce token usage
- Discussed with team about API key budget allocation

**Lesson Learned**:
Plan for API costs early and implement caching strategies

---

### Challenge 2: Frontend-Backend Type Consistency

**Problem**:
- TypeScript interfaces on frontend didn't match backend Pydantic models
- Field names inconsistent (camelCase vs snake_case)
- Led to runtime errors and debugging difficulties

**Solution**:
- Used Pydantic `alias` to map snake_case to camelCase
- Created shared type definitions
- Automated type generation (future improvement)

**Lesson Learned**:
Establish API contracts and type definitions before implementation

---

### Challenge 3: Database Migration Conflicts

**Problem**:
- Multiple team members created migrations simultaneously
- Alembic revision chain broke
- Version ID typos caused migration failures

**Solution**:
- Designated one person as "migration owner" per sprint
- Created migration checklist:
1. Pull latest `develop` branch
2. Check existing migrations
3. Create new migration
4. Test locally
5. Commit immediately to avoid conflicts
- Fixed broken chain by editing migration files

**Lesson Learned**:
Coordinate database changes and use migration naming conventions

---

### Challenge 4: Real-time Streaming Responses

**Problem**:
- OpenAI streaming API different from standard REST
- React state updates challenging with streaming data
- Cancel ongoing requests when user sends new message

**Solution**:
- Implemented custom streaming handler with `ReadableStream`
- Used `AbortController` for request cancellation
- Created buffer state for partial messages
- Added loading indicators during streaming

**Code snippet**:
```typescript
// Streaming response handler
const handleStreamingResponse = async (response: Response) => {
const reader = response.body?.getReader();
let partialMessage = '';

while (true) {
const { done, value } = await reader.read();
if (done) break;

const text = new TextDecoder().decode(value);
partialMessage += text;
setMessages(prev => updateLastMessage(prev, partialMessage));
}
};
```

**Lesson Learned**:
Research API specifics before implementation; streaming requires different handling

---

### Challenge 5: CORS Configuration

**Problem**:
- Frontend (port 5173) couldn't access backend (port 8000)
- Browser blocking requests with CORS policy error

**Solution**:
- Configured FastAPI CORS middleware:
```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
CORSMiddleware,
allow_origins=["http://localhost:5173"],
allow_credentials=True,
allow_methods=["*"],
allow_headers=["*"],
)
```
- Added CORS origins to environment variables for flexibility

**Lesson Learned**:
Configure CORS early in development to avoid repeated issues

## Key Learnings

### Technical Learnings

1. **Agile Methodology**:
- Iterative development allows for course correction
- Regular feedback prevents going too far in wrong direction
- Sprint retrospectives crucial for continuous improvement

2. **API Integration**:
- OpenAI streaming API requires different handling than REST
- Always implement error handling and fallbacks
- Cache expensive API calls when possible

3. **Full-Stack Development**:
- Clear API contracts prevent integration issues
- Type consistency between frontend/backend saves debugging time
- CORS configuration critical for local development

4. **Database Management**:
- Alembic migrations must be coordinated across team
- Always backup database before testing migrations
- Use constraints (unique, foreign keys) for data integrity

5. **User-Centric Design**:
- User feedback reveals assumptions in design
- Features like time range selection seem obvious in retrospect
- Always think "what would users want to customize?"

### Collaboration Learnings

1. **Communication**:
- Async standups work well for distributed teams
- Video calls essential for complex discussions
- Document decisions for future reference

2. **Code Review**:
- Fresh eyes catch bugs we miss
- Code reviews improve overall code quality
- Constructive feedback helps everyone learn

3. **Task Division**:
- Leverage individual strengths (frontend/backend/AI)
- Overlapping knowledge prevents bottlenecks
- Pair programming for complex features

### Process Improvements

**What We'd Do Differently**:
- Set up automated testing from Sprint 1
- Create API documentation (Swagger) earlier
- Use project management tool (Jira/Trello) for better visibility
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Set up staging environment earlier

**What Worked Well**:
- 2-week sprints gave good rhythm
- Daily async standups kept everyone aligned
- Code reviews caught many bugs early
- Documentation sprint at end was valuable
